# ConvNets_notMNITS

## Intro
This project is a basic implementation of a convolutional neural network for the not_MNIST dataset from udacity Deep Learning course. The neural network is based on LeNet architecture and is implemented in TensorFlow.
## Getting the Data
As the name sugests, the `download_and_preprocess.py` script will download and preprocess the data, saving it into the file: `notMNIST.pickle`. By default it will create a 100000 images dataset, but the user can choose another value (max 529114) by passing it as an argument for the script.
## The Model
Just follow the `ConvNet.ipynb` notebook =)!
